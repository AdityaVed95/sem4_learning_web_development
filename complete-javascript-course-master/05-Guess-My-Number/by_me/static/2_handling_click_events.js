// click is the name of the event that is going to occur : you cant give your own 
// name , the name is one from the predefined set of valid inputs 
// response is the name of the function expression , we do not call the function in line 12 
// java script engine will call the function when the event happens
// the function is going to be executed when the button gets clicked

// the funciton will not be called immediately once the script is executed, it will 
// only be called as soon as the event happens
